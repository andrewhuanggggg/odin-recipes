        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>4 skin-on, boneless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Pat chicken thighs dry with a paper towel and brush the skin-side of each piece with olive oil. Place chicken thighs, skin-side down, in a single layer on a plate.</li>
                <li>Combine smoked paprika, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl and sprinkle half the seasoning mixture evenly over the 4 chicken thighs. Turn thighs over and evenly sprinkle remaining seasoning mixture on top. 
                    Place chicken thighs in the air fryer basket in a single layer, skin-side up.</li>
                <li>Fry in the preheated air fryer until chicken is brown and juices run clear, about 18 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            </ol>
